<h3>Steps</h3>
<ul>
  <br>
  <li>Steps Completed:</li>
  <ol>
    <p>&#x2713; Step 1: Write the function printString() to print a string to video</p>
    <p>&#x2713; Step 2: Write the function readString() to read a line of input from the keyboard</p>
    <p>&#x2713; Step 3: Write the function readSector() to read a sector from memory</p>
    <p>&#x2713; Step 4: Write the function handleInterrupt21() to handle the system interrupt 21</p>
    <p>&#x2713; Step 5: Add a switch statement to handleInterrupt21() to allow the functions made in the previous steps to be called by system interrupt 21</p>
  </ol>
  <br>
  <li>Added a suggested printChar function for debugging purposes later in this project</li>
</ul>
